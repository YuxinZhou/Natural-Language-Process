1	So shall I live, supposing thou art true,	s
2	Sets down her babe and makes an swift dispatch	s
3	Against the wreckful siege of battering days,	s
4	AND now the house-dog stretched once more	b
5	Which I by lacking have supposed dead,	s
6	And Faith itself is wavering now ;	b
7	If it were fill'd with your most high deserts?	s
8	Who all life long has loved the snow	b
9	To weigh how once I suffered in your crime.	s
10	Strove to waken music there ;	b
11	And, with sudden check, the heaving	b
12	The heart I love and you deride	b
13	Of their fair subject, blessing every book	s
14	Or me, to whom thou gavest it, else mistaking;	s
15	If Time have any wrinkle graven there;	s
16	From Gondal's stormy sea.	b
17	Or laid great bases for eternity,	s
18	The scope and tenor of thy jealousy?	s
19	And I never longed for joys divine.	b
20	And pale death changed that cheek divine	b
21	Although our undivided loves are one:	s
22	Kill me with spites; yet we must not be foes.	s
23	And saved my life, saying 'not you.'	s
24	Thought again to what has been ?	b
25	Wasted, worn is the traveller,	b
26	Who plead for love and look for recompense	s
27	That every tongue says beauty should look so.	s
28	With ugly rack on his celestial face,	s
29	< To a silent home thy feet may come,	b
30	I heard those notes in Elbe Hall,	b
31	This heart burns with thee and me,	b
32	A sentence, unapproved, and overruled by Heaven.	b
33	So am I as the rich, whose blessed key	s
34	What woke it then ? A little child	b
35	Now wildly shade my sunburnt neck,	b
36	More flowers I noted, yet I none could see	s
37	Harp, in other earlier days	b
38	Breathed forth the sound that said 'I hate'	s
39	And none of all those thousand round	b
40	As from this city to the southern seas.	b
41	But earth was bathed in other gore ;	b
42	Scarce bound by its worn chains of clay,	b
43	O thou, my lovely boy, who in thy power	s
44	Warnings, reproaches, both were vain ;	b
45	When proud-pied April dress'd in all his trim	s
46	Unmarked I gazed, my idle thought	b
47	But bears it out even to the edge of doom.	s
48	Dear lady, slumber now !	b
49	Well I know thine eye would never	b
50	Then in the number let me pass untold,	s
51	Or is he on the sea?	b
52	And you have all your lives for grief.'	b
53	The very brightness of the sun,	b
54	Naming thy name blesses an ill report.	s
55	Compared with loss of thee will not seem so.	s
56	Ethereal music fills the air,	b
57	For at a frown they in their glory die.	s
58	Yet nor the lays of birds nor the sweet smell	s
59	For she hath no excheckr now but his,	s
60	Leagues off I heard their thundering roar,	b
61	Whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken.	s
62	1 Preserve Thy mortal shrine,	b
63	Of rock with wave, and wave with rock ;	b
64	Eat up thy charge? is this thy body's end?	s
65	To thy fair flower add the rank smell of weeds:	s
66	And still the more beloved, the greater still	b
67	And feel no other earthly bliss	b
68	Wander about the silent dwelling,	b
69	So are those errors that in thee are seen	s
70	Were pitched 'gainst traitorous crime ;	b
71	WHEN weary with the long day's care,	b
72	Then soul, live thou upon thy servant's loss,	s
73	A part of God himself shall shine	b
74	As victors of my silence cannot boast;	s
75	Those tiny hands in vain essay	b
76	As sweet tears never melted down	b
77	After a thousand victories once foil'd,	s
78	Must slake her vengeance now !	b
79	And the smile of joy is banished	b
80	All soft, and still, and fair ;	b
81	With never-failing thankfulness,	b
82	Too base of thee to be remembered.	s
83	Make answer, Muse: wilt thou not haply say	s
84	And will, thy soul knows, is admitted there;	s
85	More worthy I to be beloved of thee.	s
86	WHICH I RODE AT THE BATTLE OF ZAMORNA	b
87	To do more for me than mine own desert,	s
88	Even so my sun one early morn did shine	s
89	But where is all their anguish now,	b
90	I '11 walk, but not in old heroic traces,	b
91	Like a star it sparkled through.	b
92	But ah! thought kills me that I am not thought,	s
93	The moon is bright in Autumn's sky,	b
94	All too like that dreary eve,	b
95	That I have frequent been with unknown minds	s
96	Waves above thy cradle break,	b
97	And wherefore say not I that I am old?	s
98	They must be the chaplet to wreathe my head,	b
99	* The baited tiger could not be	b
100	So deem I now and time will prove	b
101	And all these dim, disjointed dreams	b
102	Make thee another self, for love of me,	s
103	And my sick Muse doth give another place.	s
104	If the true concord of well-tuned sounds,	s
105	Love's eye is not so true as all men's 'No.'	s
106	Life that in me has rest,	b
107	But most throughout the moral world	b
108	A quest of thoughts, all tenants to the heart,	s
109	The bright rosebuds, those hawthorn shrouds	b
110	And sue a friend came debtor for my sake;	s
111	To take a new acquaintance of thy mind.	s
112	Often he looks o'er his dreary road,	b
113	Thou shouldst live in eternal spring,	b
114	Had they but known her dreary doom,	b
115	And die as fast as they see others grow;	s
116	May flow down like a river :	b
117	To bless my spirit now.	b
118	Men who hate me kneel before me,	b
119	How wildly fancy plays.	b
120	Yet I could hear my lady sing ;	b
121	Thy looks should nothing thence but sweetness tell.	s
122	While I lie fettered here !	b
123	And that, in guess, they measure by thy deeds;	s
124	That they elsewhere might dart their injuries:	s
125	And drowns the turret bell,	b
126	Whose mighty minds with kindred lay,	b
127	Coming as swiftly and fading as soon.	b
128	Therefore desire of perfect'st love being made,	s
129	I never saw that you did painting need	s
130	The humble salve which wounded bosoms fits!	s
131	Let me confess that we two must be twain,	s
132	Foamy tears are on thy cheek,	b
133	Then can I drown an eye, unused to flow,	s
134	And that fresh blood which youngly thou bestowest	s
135	He had watched with tend'rest care.	b
136	So, love, be thou; although to-day thou fill	s
137	But sorrow withers e'en the strong,	b
138	What thou dost foist upon us that is old,	s
139	As every alien pen hath got my use	s
140	My slave, my comrade, and my king.	b
141	Art glad to leave the sea,	b
142	Hast faithless been to him ?	b
143	Whilst I, my sovereign, watch the clock for you,	s
144	Of happiness or woe?	b
145	Declining to the afternoon ;	b
146	The morning sunshine had called him forth,	b
147	But thence I learn, and find the lesson true,	s
148	And sable curls all silver'd o'er with white;	s
149	Look, what thy memory can not contain	s
150	That black treason uttered well	b
